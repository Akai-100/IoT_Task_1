ESP32 Operating Algorithm:

1- Download and install Arduino IDE.
2- Connect USB wire to ESP32.
3- Try to upload an example such as Blink to check if your computer can identify the ESP32.
4- If the code is uploaded successfully you are good to go.
5- If it didn't work, you need to identify it manually by installing the specific driver for the ESP32 to your computer, then it should work.
